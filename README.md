# chat-app
Join the chat-room: https://jalptech.web.app/ 

JalpTech, is a recently created chat-room among different users for the purpose of exchanging ideas during the pandemic days in 2021 form our homes. It is created with React JS, using the << class >> component and the firebase as the database needed for saving the user's credentials after registering the first time in the platform. Also, CSS was quite important for a better visualisation and to attract the user. 

This application, was mainly build to adapt the security measurements within a web-application. 

Check the comments within the file projects for a better understaning of how the chat-app is build.
